# Python Project: Generating Keywords for Google Ads
This project contains fictitious data for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. Our task is to create a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With intermediate Python skills, I can efficiently create these keywords!

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.
