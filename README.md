# Python Project: Generating Keywords for Google Ads
This project contains fictitious data for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. Our task is to create a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With intermediate Python skills, I can efficiently create these keywords!

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.

## Skills Covered:

- Python Programming: The project showcases my intermediate Python skills, as I utilized Python to efficiently create keywords for search campaigns.

- Data Manipulation with Pandas: Utilizing the Pandas library to handle and manipulate data in a DataFrame. Performing operations such as creating DataFrames from lists, renaming columns, and appending DataFrames.

- Looping and List Manipulation: Using loops to iterate through product names and words, generating combinations and appending them to the keywords_list.

- Data Analysis: Exploring the data and creating a summary of the campaign work by grouping and counting the keywords for each ad group and criterion type.
